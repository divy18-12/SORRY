# Apology Webpage

This repo contains the full apology webpage for GitHub Pages deployment.

- index.html — full single-file page (envelope, tap-to-open, animations).
- assets/ — put your song as `assets/song.mp3` before deploying.

To publish:
1. Push these files to a GitHub repo and enable GitHub Pages (main branch, root).
2. Make sure `assets/song.mp3` is present if you want music to play.
