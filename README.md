# Apology Webpage (Fresh)

This repository contains a minimal single-page apology webpage.

Files included:
- `index.html` — the webpage (placeholder in this fresh zip).
- `assets/` — folder for media (place your song file here as `song.mp3`).

How to update with the full project:
1. Replace `index.html` with the full `index.html` I provided earlier (envelope, animations, tap-to-open).
2. Put your audio file as `assets/song.mp3`.
3. (Optional) Put any QR image or video in `assets/` as well.
   - Note: the uploaded video in this session is available at this path on the server:  
     `/mnt/data/VID_20251122_060533_822.mp4`

Deploy to GitHub Pages:
1. Create a new GitHub repo, e.g. `apology-qr`.
2. Push these files to the repo root.
3. In repository Settings → Pages, enable GitHub Pages from the main branch and root folder.
4. Your site will be available at: `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/`

Notes:
- If you want, I can replace the placeholder index.html here with the full working apology page and re-zip again.
- The server path above (`/mnt/data/...`) is the uploaded video in this session; move it into the repo `assets/` before push if you want to serve it from the site.
